## Why pursr?

Most teams need **five separate tools** to do visual QA: a screenshot CLI, a regression diff runner, an accessibility auditor, a way to share captures with an AI assistant, and a way to **turn all of that into a PDF report** for stakeholders. **pursr is all five** - built as a single Node.js package with:

- **A unified CLI** (`pursr`) for every capture, diff, sweep, and audit.
- **An agent-grade MCP stdio server** (`pursr-mcp`) built on the official Model Context Protocol SDK, with persistent tabs, direct image responses, rendered-state inspection, actions, diagnostics, screenshots, sweeps, and resources.
- **Visual Operator** sessions with a rendered cursor, target labels, click markers, visible Chrome windows, and authenticated Chrome attachment over CDP.
- **A library API** with 25 subpath modules, so you can embed the browser and QA primitives in your own tooling.
- **A plugin system** for custom viewports, sweep ops, and capture hooks.
- **PDF reports + AI diff summaries** built in - render a sweep to a styled PDF or ask a vision LLM to describe the regression in plain language.
- **Zero browser bundled** - drives your system Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Chromium via Playwright. No surprise browser download during install.
- **First-run doctor + update notices** - diagnose missing browser/runtime pieces and get lightweight release notifications without breaking CI or JSON output.

## Install

```bash
npm install pursr
npm install --save-dev playwright-core   # peer dep - bring your own Chrome
```

Then verify:

```bash
pursr doctor                    # check Node, playwright-core, browser, and SKILL.md
pursr setup                     # print next steps if anything is missing
pursr viewports                 # list 10+ registered viewport presets
pursr probe https://example.com # health check
```

Pursr intentionally does **not** download browsers during `npm install`. Install Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Chromium yourself, or point Pursr at a Chrome-compatible executable:

```bash
# Windows
setx PURSR_BROWSER_PATH "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"

# macOS/Linux
export PURSR_BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

Browser discovery checks standard global installs, user installs, Dev/Beta/Canary/Nightly channels, and executable names found in `PATH` across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Current target is Chromium-family browsers; Firefox/WebKit are planned, but not claimed as stable targets yet.

CLI update notifications are cached for 24 hours, written to stderr, and disabled automatically in CI/non-interactive runs. Disable them manually with `PURSR_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`.

## 30 seconds

```bash
# 1. Capture a screenshot with overlays
pursr shoot https://example.com shot.png \
  --preset desktop-1280 --grid --grid-tile 64

# 2. Save it as a visual baseline
pursr baseline save myapp shot.png home --url https://example.com

# 3. Next time you run, compare against the baseline
pursr diff https://example.com \
  ~/.pursr/baselines/myapp/<id>/home.png \
  diff.png

# 4. Or: run a batched sweep + a11y audit + parallel workers
pursr sweep ./plan.json   # see plans/ for an example
```

## Recipes

### Visual diff

Capture a reference image once, then compare the current page against it after
each UI change. The diff image and JSON summary are written to the paths you
choose:

```bash
mkdir -p captures
pursr shot https://example.com ./captures/reference.png
pursr diff https://example.com ./captures/reference.png ./captures/current-diff.png
```

### CI sweep

Install `pursr` and `playwright-core` as development dependencies, then keep a
sweep plan in your repository and run it in CI. A sweep writes
`sweep.json`, `sweep.junit.xml`, `sweep.github.json`, and `sweep.md` next to its
captures. The extra Node check makes the job fail when any step fails, while
the artifact upload preserves the screenshots and reports for review:

```yaml
- run: npm ci
- name: Install Chromium
  run: |
    npx playwright-core install --with-deps chromium
    node -e "const fs=require('node:fs'); const {chromium}=require('playwright-core'); fs.appendFileSync(process.env.GITHUB_ENV, 'PURSR_BROWSER_PATH='+chromium.executablePath()+'\n');"
- run: npx pursr sweep ./plans/visual-regression.json --out-dir ./artifacts/pursr
- run: node -e "const s=require('./artifacts/pursr/sweep.json'); if (s.steps.some(step => !step.ok)) process.exit(1)"
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: pursr-sweep
    path: artifacts/pursr
```

### MCP server

Add pursr to an MCP client when an agent needs persistent browser sessions,
screenshots, or diagnostics. The server uses the Chrome-compatible browser and
`playwright-core` already installed in the host environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pursr": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "pursr-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```

### Subcommands

Flags are order-independent. Both commands below are valid, and explicit output paths override Pursr's default output directory:

```bash
pursr shot --preset desktop-1280 https://example.com --out ./captures/home.png
pursr full https://example.com --preset desktop-1280 --out-dir ./captures
```

`--out` is a complete file path. `--out-dir` is a directory where Pursr writes the command's standard filename.

| Subcommand | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `doctor` | Diagnose Node, `playwright-core`, browser discovery, and packaged skill availability |
| `setup` | Print first-run setup guidance without auto-installing browsers |
| `probe` | Health check (HTTP status, page title) |
| `shot` / `full` | Viewport / full-page screenshot |
| `eval` | Execute JS in the page, return result |
| `click` / `type` / `wait` / `seq` | Interaction primitives |
| `operator` | Run a visible action plan with cursor feedback, screenshot, trace, diagnostics, and optional WebM video |
| `diff` | Pixel-level diff vs a reference PNG |
| `viewports` | List all registered viewport presets |
| `shoot` | Rich capture (overlays, freeze, camera, plugins) |
| `layer` | Capture one isolated layer (entity/hud/ui/terrain) |
| `frames` | N-frame animation timeline at interval |
| `hover` | Hover state capture |
| `sweep` | Batched capture plan -> HTML report + CI output |
| `audit` | axe-core WCAG accessibility audit + highlighted screenshot |
| `dom` / `dom-snapshot` | Serialized DOM + CSS selectors + XPath + bounding rects |
| `every-viewport` | Capture once per preset in parallel (3-wide pool) |
| `baseline` | save / list / approve / show visual baselines |
| `auth` | save / load / list / delete Playwright storageState |
| `validate` | Validate a sweep plan JSON without running it |

### Agent Skill

The npm package includes [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md), a compact operating guide for coding agents. Point an agent at `node_modules/pursr/SKILL.md`, or copy it into the skill directory used by your agent host. It explains when to use CLI versus MCP, correct argument order, action plans, visual verification, and safety boundaries.

## MCP Server

`pursr-mcp` exposes every capability as MCP tools over stdio - works with Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, and any MCP host.

```bash
npx pursr-mcp
# or with verbose logging:
npx pursr-mcp --verbose
```

### Exposed Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pursr_session_open` | Open a headless, visible, or CDP browser session with optional Visual Operator |
| `pursr_sessions` | List active browser sessions |
| `pursr_snapshot` | Visible rendered nodes, geometry, semantics, and computed styles |
| `pursr_act` | Interact with per-action timeouts, caller-controlled force fallback, strict `eval.js`, cursor movement, and annotations |
| `pursr_screenshot` | Return the current PNG directly to the vision model, with bounded selector and CDP clip fallback |
| `pursr_inspect` | Inspect exact geometry, computed styles, and stacking ancestors |
| `pursr_diagnostics` | Read console, page errors, failed requests, and HTTP failures |
| `pursr_session_close` | Close the tab and release its browser process |
| `pursr_shoot` | Rich screenshot capture (viewport, grid, layer, cursor, camera, animation freeze, HAR) |
| `pursr_diff` | Pixel-diff a URL against a reference PNG |
| `pursr_sweep` | Execute a batch sweep plan |
| `pursr_frames` | Capture an N-frame animation timeline |
| `pursr_probe` | Health-check a URL |
| `pursr_audit` | axe-core WCAG audit + highlighted screenshot |
| `pursr_dom_snapshot` | Full DOM + selector map snapshot |
| `pursr_check` | CI visual regression check against a stable baseline |

### Agent workflow

Use persistent sessions for the same inspect-act-verify loop as an interactive browser agent:

1. Call `pursr_session_open` once with a stable `sessionId`.
2. Call `pursr_snapshot` to understand the rendered page before acting.
3. Use `pursr_act` for a small, ordered interaction sequence.
4. Call `pursr_screenshot` when visual judgment matters; the model receives the PNG directly.
5. Use `pursr_inspect` for layout, clipping, typography, or stacking problems.
6. Read `pursr_diagnostics`, then reload and verify after source changes.
7. Call `pursr_session_close` when the review is complete.

Example action arguments:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "farm",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "hover", "selector": "role=button|Build" },
    { "type": "click", "selector": "text=Barn", "timeoutMs": 3000 },
    { "type": "wait", "selector": "role=dialog" },
    { "type": "eval", "js": "({ title: document.title })" }
  ]
}
```

Eval actions require a non-empty `js` field; the legacy `script` field is rejected instead of reporting a false-positive success. `force: true` is never automatic. Use it only after inspection confirms the intended target. If a locator itself stalls, the final page-level DOM fallback accepts a CSS selector; other selector dialects can use a verified coordinate fallback.

### Visual Operator

Set `visual: true` to render the agent cursor and interaction feedback into screenshots. `mode: "visible"` enables it automatically and opens a Chrome window that a developer can watch.

#### CLI: scripted tutorials and repeatable recordings

Use the CLI when the steps are already known. It needs no MCP host and produces a final screenshot, JSON trace, diagnostics, and an optional WebM recording.

```bash
pursr operator http://localhost:3000 @plans/operator-tutorial.json \
  --visible \
  --start-delay 3000 \
  --slow-mo 100 \
  --video ./recordings \
  --out ./recordings/final.png
```

The action plan is a JSON array. The same action objects work through `pursr_act` in MCP:

```json
[
  { "type": "annotate", "selector": "role=button|Build", "label": "Open build menu" },
  { "type": "click", "selector": "role=button|Build", "durationMs": 350, "settleMs": 500 },
  { "type": "click", "x": 640, "y": 420, "durationMs": 250 },
  { "type": "drag", "fromX": 520, "fromY": 400, "toX": 760, "toY": 520, "steps": 30 },
  { "type": "keyDown", "key": "Shift" },
  { "type": "keyUp", "key": "Shift" },
  { "type": "press", "key": "Escape" },
  { "type": "sleep", "ms": 800 },
  { "type": "clearAnnotations", "keepCursor": true }
]
```

Chrome records the browser viewport as silent WebM video. Add narration or system audio in your editor, and convert to MP4 when needed:

```bash
ffmpeg -i recording.webm -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p tutorial.mp4
```

#### MCP: adaptive agent operation

Use MCP when the agent must inspect the current page, decide the next action, verify visual results, or pause for human approval. MCP is not required for CLI recording. Both interfaces use the same session and Visual Operator engine.

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "sessionId": "visual-review",
  "mode": "visible",
  "operatorColor": "#ff2ea6",
  "slowMo": 80
}
```

Add `recordVideoDir` to record an MCP session in headless or visible mode. The final video path is returned by `pursr_session_close`. CDP sessions preserve an existing browser profile but cannot record video because Chrome owns that context.

Visual actions use the regular `pursr_act` tool:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "visual-review",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "move", "x": 640, "y": 360, "durationMs": 300 },
    { "type": "annotate", "selector": "role=button|Publish", "label": "Primary CTA" },
    { "type": "click", "selector": "#publish", "timeoutMs": 1500, "force": true },
    { "type": "clearAnnotations", "keepCursor": true }
  ]
}
```

To use an existing authenticated Chrome profile, start Chrome with a dedicated remote-debugging profile and attach using CDP. Do not expose the debugging port beyond localhost.

```bash
chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/pursr-chrome
```

```json
{
  "url": "https://app.example.com",
  "sessionId": "signed-in-review",
  "mode": "cdp",
  "cdpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:9222",
  "visual": true
}
```

Pursr opens a new tab in Chrome's default context, preserving that profile's cookies and login state. Closing the Pursr session disconnects without terminating the owner browser.

### Exposed Resources

| URI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pursr://shoot/<url|preset>` | Last screenshot PNG (image/png) |
| `pursr://sweep/<plan-name>` | Last sweep summary JSON (application/json) |

Resources are persisted to `~/.pursr/mcp/mcp-index.json` (override with `PURSR_MCP_STATE`).

## Visual Regression Baselines

```bash
pursr baseline save myapp ./out/shoot.png home --url https://my.app
pursr baseline approve myapp ./out/shoot.png home --url https://my.app
pursr baseline list myapp
pursr baseline show myapp home --url https://my.app
```

Baselines live under `~/.pursr/baselines/<project>/<id>/<step>.png` + `manifest.json`. Override with `PURSR_BASELINES_DIR`. The `id` is a 16-char SHA1 prefix of `url|viewport|flags` so re-running a sweep maps to the same slot deterministically.

```js
import { diffKey, saveBaseline, loadBaseline } from "pursr/baseline";
const id = diffKey({ url: "https://my.app", viewport: { width: 1280, height: 800, dpr: 1 }, flags: { preset: "desktop-1280" } });
saveBaseline({ project: "myapp", id, step: "home", png: "./shot.png", meta: { url: "https://my.app" } });
```

## Sweep Plan Validation

```bash
pursr validate ./plan.json
# { "valid": false, "errors": ["steps[2].frames.count: must be a number between 1 and 120"] }
```

Catches: empty steps, unknown ops, out-of-range numbers, duplicate names, missing required fields. `pursr sweep` runs the same validator before executing - fail-fast.

```json
{
  "name": "homepage-matrix",
  "base": "https://example.com",
  "parallel": 4,
  "steps": [
    { "name": "baseline",   "shoot":  { "preset": "desktop-1280" } },
    { "name": "grid-64",    "shoot":  { "preset": "desktop-1280", "grid": true, "grid-tile": 64 } },
    { "name": "tablet",     "shoot":  { "preset": "tablet-768" } },
    { "name": "mobile",     "shoot":  { "preset": "mobile-375" } },
    { "name": "hover-cta",  "hover":  { "selector": ["text=Get started", "a.btn-primary"] } },
    { "name": "audit",      "audit":  { "tags": "wcag2a,wcag2aa" } },
    { "name": "diff",       "diff":   { "ref": "baseline" } }
  ]
}
```

## HAR Capture

```bash
pursr shoot https://example.com shot.png --har ./out/req.har.json
```

```js
import { startHarCapture, stopHarCapture, writeHar } from "pursr/har";
const state = await startHarCapture(page);
await page.goto(url);
const har = stopHarCapture(page);
await writeHar(har, "./out/req.har.json");
```

Output is HAR 1.2 spec - pipe to `har-cli`, perf-tools, or any visualizer.

## Auth State

```bash
pursr auth save myapp admin --from ./playwright-state.json
pursr shoot https://my.app/dashboard shot.png --auth-state admin --auth-project myapp
pursr auth list myapp
pursr auth load myapp admin --out ./round-trip.json
pursr auth delete myapp admin
```

States live in `~/.pursr/auth/<project>/<name>.json` (override with `PURSR_AUTH_DIR`). The on-disk format is the standard Playwright `storageState` shape: `{ cookies, origins }`.

## Parallel Sweep

Add `parallel: N` to your plan to run steps concurrently in a worker pool:

```json
{
  "name": "matrix",
  "base": "https://my.app",
  "parallel": 4,
  "steps": [
    { "name": "home",    "shoot": { "preset": "desktop-1280" } },
    { "name": "pricing", "shoot": { "preset": "desktop-1280" } },
    { "name": "docs",    "shoot": { "preset": "desktop-1280" } }
  ]
}
```

Steps run in a shared browser context; results are still ordered by index in the summary. Defaults to serial (`parallel: 1`) - opt in only when steps are independent.

## Accessibility Audit

```bash
pursr audit https://example.com --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa
# Writes: audit.json, audit-summary.md, audit-highlighted.png
```

Injects axe-core, runs a configurable tag set (`wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, `wcag21aa`, `best-practice`), and overlays a red outline on every violating node with the rule id as a label. The summary Markdown includes per-rule failure snippets.

## DOM Snapshot

```bash
pursr dom https://example.com
# Writes: dom-snapshot-<ts>.dom.json
```

Captures serialized HTML, computed CSS for every visible element, and a selector map (`id`, `role`, `accessible name`, `text`, `xpath`, `css selector`, viewport-relative `rect`). Great for regression diffing without re-running a browser.

## CI Output

Every sweep writes three sidecar artifacts alongside `sweep.json`:

- `sweep.junit.xml` - JUnit XML for Jenkins / GitLab / CircleCI
- `sweep.github.json` - GitHub Actions annotation file
- `sweep.md` - Human-readable Markdown summary with diffs + failures

## Plugins

A plugin is a plain ES module that exports a default object:

```js
// plugins/my-plugin.js
export default {
  name: "my-plugin",
  viewport: { "my-laptop": { width: 1440, height: 900, dpr: 2, label: "MBP 14" } },
  sweepOp: {
    lighthouse: async (ctx, opts) => { /* ... */ },
  },
  beforeShoot: async (ctx) => { /* mutate ctx.flags / ctx.viewport */ },
  afterShoot:  async (ctx, meta) => { /* augment sidecar */ },
  flagHelp:    { "my-flag": "what it does" },
};
```

Plugins are auto-loaded from `plugins/` (built-in) or via `--plugin <path>`.

## Architecture

```
src/
  index.js          - public library entry
  mcp.js            - official MCP SDK stdio server
  session.js        - persistent headless, visible, and CDP sessions

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xheycat/pursr
cd pursr
npm install
npm install --save-dev playwright-core
npm test
```

`npm test` runs 63 unit + integration tests (Node's built-in test runner, zero test deps). Coverage includes: viewport resolution, flag parsing, selector parsing, HTML escaping, hashing, baseline storage, sweep-plan validation, MCP resources, HAR 1.2 shape, auth state, and end-to-end CLI smoke tests.

```
src/           - 29 modules
test/          - 63 tests, 0 failures
plugins/       - 2 built-in plugins, auto-loaded
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Visual baselines (save / approve / diff)
- [x] Sweep plan schema validation
- [x] MCP resources (browse past captures from your AI host)
- [x] HAR 1.2 capture
- [x] Auth state (Playwright storageState)
- [x] Parallel sweep workers
- [x] Watch mode (`pursr watch <url>`)
- [x] Component-level snapshot (`pursr snap <selector>`)
- [x] PDF report export (`pursr report --sweep`)
- [ ] Cloud output adapters (S3 / GCS)
- [x] AI diff summary (vision model, `--ai`)

## PDF Report (v0.6.0)

Turn any sweep summary into a styled, self-contained A4 PDF you can email, attach to a PR, or hand to a designer.

```bash
# 1. Run a sweep (writes sweep.json + index.html + per-step PNGs)
pursr sweep ./plans/marketing.json

# 2. Generate a PDF from the most recent sweep
pursr report --sweep ./out/sweep-marketing/sweep.json --out ./out/report.pdf

# Or: skip image embedding for a tiny text-only report
pursr report --sweep ./out/sweep-marketing/sweep.json --no-embed
```

The PDF includes a colored header (pursr brand magenta), a summary stat grid (steps / passed / failed / total time), and a per-step card with: status badge, op + duration + URL, the embedded capture PNG, diff stats, audit violation count, and any error message. Page numbers in the footer.

Library:

```js
import { renderSweepPdf } from "pursr/report";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const summary = JSON.parse(readFileSync("./sweep.json", "utf8"));
const bytes = await renderSweepPdf(summary, { out: "./report.pdf" });
console.log("wrote", bytes.length, "bytes");
```

## AI Diff Summary (v0.6.0)

Add `--ai` to `pursr diff` and a vision LLM describes the differences in plain language alongside the pixel-diff percentage. Perfect for triaging a regression without opening the PNG.

```bash
# Basic
pursr diff https://my.app ./ref.png ./out/diff.png --ai

# Custom model + endpoint + key (e.g. local llama.cpp, Codex proxy, OpenAI)
pursr diff https://my.app ./ref.png ./out/diff.png \
  --ai --ai-model gh/gpt-5.4 \
  --ai-base-url http://127.0.0.1:20128/v1 \
  --ai-api-key sk-...
```

The AI summary is written to `<out>.ai.json` (or alongside the current PNG) and is also attached to the diff result object as `r.ai = { aiSummary, aiModel, aiElapsedMs, aiAt }`.

Auth is picked up from these env vars (in order):

```
PURSR_AI_API_KEY  (preferred)
PURSOR_AI_API_KEY (legacy alias)
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Base URL: `PURSR_AI_BASE_URL` (falls back to `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` then `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
Model:   `PURSR_AI_MODEL` (falls back to `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` then `gpt-4o`).

Library:

```js
import { aiDiffSummary, aiDiffSidecar } from "pursr/ai-diff";

const r = await aiDiffSummary({
  refPath: "./ref.png",
  curPath: "./out/diff-current.png",
  url: "https://my.app",
  model: "gpt-4o",
});
console.log(r.summary);   // markdown bullet report
console.log(r.elapsedMs); // how long the LLM took

// Or attach to a sweep step:
const sidecar = await aiDiffSidecar({ refPath, curPath, url });
```

## Watch Mode (v0.5.0)

```bash
# Re-shoot every time a CSS or HTML file changes
pursr watch https://my.app --on src/**/*.css --on src/**/*.html

# Re-run a sweep plan on file change
pursr watch --plan ./plan.json --on src/**/*.{css,html}

# Default (no --on) = watch everything in cwd
pursr watch https://my.app
```

Glob patterns: * (one path segment), ** (any depth), ? (one char), backslash-X (literal X). Debounce is 300ms by default.

## Component Snapshots (v0.5.0)

```bash
# Capture one screenshot per matched element
pursr snap https://my.app a.btn --out ./snaps --max 20

# Use auto-heal selector chain
pursr snap https://my.app "text=Sign up" --out ./snaps

# Promote to baselines in one command
pursr snap https://my.app article.product --baseline myapp
```

Each capture is clipped precisely to the elements bounding box (even when scrolled offscreen), labelled with aria-label / text / tag, and written to ./snaps/<index>-<label>.png + snap.json summary.
